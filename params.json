I also hope to improve my English writing skills through this page. Any corrections, please send them my way. :)\r\n\r\n### Mission:\r\nTo inspire others to do the same thing. My friends specially! :D\r\n\r\n### Social:\r\nI have purposely deactivated my Facebook account. I will perhaps write an article why I did that. I hope this page will serve as a way for me to socialize a bit more! :)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to connect with me, I am on Instagram and Twitter as @dibbeelyn. Feel free to connect!\r\n\r\nSo, let's get started! For starters, I apologize it's gonna be messy but I will do some decluttering once I master this coding thing. :D\r\n\r\n### April 12, 2016\r\n**Apple Cider Vinegar for Diet?**\r\n\r\nReally?! Yep, that was exactly my first reaction. A colleague at work shared how she's been using ACV for almost everything. From facial toner, cooking ingredient, diet and tons of health benefits. So, I got real curious and went to Google for validation. To my surprise, this vinegar is actually very famous! Sorry for sounding ignorant. Lol! We just don't have this in common households in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to share some of my observations and findings from using it. There are tons of other uses but I can only speak for what I have tried and experienced. These are purely my own opinion.\r\n\r\n* **Helps with digestion** \r\nMake a juice out of it. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of ACV + 1 tablespoon of honey (any kind will  do). Consume on an empty stomach in the morning, 20 minutes before every meal. I've been doing this for 2 weeks now and I'm glad to share that I think it is really effective. I feel full most of the times. I don't have as much cravings as I had before. I'm also sometimes constipated but now, my bowel movement seem to have regulated. \r\n\r\n* **A perfect ingredient for your Adobo recipes**\r\nI tried replacing the regular vinegar with ACV in cooking chicken adobo and it turned out to be just perfect! The chicken was zestier and tastier. I'm pretty sure it will work just fine with pork adobo. :) Super recommend it!\r\n\r\nSo this is the brand of ACV I am using and here's what it looks like:\r\n\r\n![](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0pPdRdh2CUvVlNUemItUlo2bDg/view?usp=sharing)\r\nIt cost Php373 for a 473ml bottle. I bought mine from SM supermarket. I will keep this article updated as soon as I discover other uses of ACV.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
