I also hope to improve my English writing skills through this page. Any corrections, please send them my way. :)\r\n\r\n### Mission:\r\nTo inspire others to do the same thing. My friends specially! :D\r\n\r\n### Social:\r\nI have purposely deactivated my Facebook account. I will perhaps write an article why I did that. I hope this page will serve as a way for me to socialize a bit more! :)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to connect with me, I am on Instragram and Twitter as @dibbeelyn. Feel free to connect!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
